### Hi there, I'm Emon 👋
---
#### By the year 2050, 17% of my motherland, Bangladesh, will be under the rising sea levels. This creates impacts such as the loss of livable and arable land, leading to more population density and lower food production. The goal for my next job, is to find a web3 role that will provide me skills to support my nation.

### A little about me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on smart contracts
- 🌱 I’m learning to become a web3 full stack developer / product manager
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help provide a positive impact to society
- 💬 Ask me about pursuing possibilities in web3 to solve the question, “How can decentralized technologies benefit refugees?”
- 🤷🏽   Pronouns: They / He
